# Drawing Tools

ReactDraw uses a plugin system for drawing tools.
This allows you to have full control over the functionality of the component.
You can import the tools you want, hook in to the drawing stages, and create your own tools.
The type definition of a drawing tool is described by the typescript below.

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>icon: </strong> the icon to be displayed in the top bar tools
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>id</strong> required so that react draw can identify objects created
    by this id
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>cursor</strong> sets the the cursor of the mouse while over the
    viewContainer
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>onDrawStart</strong> called on mousedown/touchstart. includes data
    like the coordinates, etc. (see more below)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>onDrawing</strong> called during each new point. (mousemove)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>onDrawEnd</strong> called after mouseup/touchend
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>onResize</strong> called when the object is being resized (corner
    expand action while using select tool)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>DrawingData</strong> includes the mouse coordinates, the container
    div, current styles, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>viewContainer</strong> the div that is the react-draw full drawing
    area. This is used to help calculate relative coordinates.
  </li>
</ul>

More of the types included in the <b>Type Descriptions</b> page.

```typescript
type DrawingTools = {
  icon: JSX.Element;
  id: string;
  onDrawStart: (data: DrawingData, viewContainer: HTMLDivElement) => void;
  onDrawing: (data: DrawingData, viewContainer: HTMLDivElement) => void;
  onDrawEnd: (data: DrawingData, viewContainer: HTMLDivElement) => void;
  onResize: (data: DrawingData, ctx: OnResizeContext) => void;
  cursor?: string;
};
```

## Free Draw Tool

For example here is the free draw tool implementation.

<p>
  During <b>onDrawStart</b> the free draw tool creates a circle since there is
  only a single <b>data.coords `Point`</b>. An svg element is created and then
  appended a child to the object container. The object container is a <b>div</b>
  element that is created for you at the correct position in the <b>
    "viewContainer"
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  During <b>onDrawing</b> the tool must expand the <b>"viewContainer" div</b> to
  be the correct dimensions. Then a new svg is created based on the{" "}
  <b>data.coords</b> information. It's important to note that the{" "}
  <b>data.coords</b> points are <b>[x, y]</b> coordinates relative to the{" "}
  <b>viewContainer</b>. Drawing in the top left corner of the drawing area will
  be represented by <b>[0, 0]</b> and the bottom right corner is represented by{" "}
  <b>[width, height]</b>.
</p>
<p>
  During <b>onDrawEnd</b> no more work needs to be done.
</p>
<p>
  During <b>onResize</b> the div has been set to the correct dimensions for you
  and so we need to take care of scaling the svg inside.
</p>

```typescript
const freeDrawTool: DrawingTools = {
  id: "free-draw-tool",
  icon: <PencilBoldIcon />,
  onDrawStart: (data) => {
    const lineWidth = data.style.lineWidth;
    const newSvg = createSvg(lineWidth, lineWidth);
    const newPath = createCircle(lineWidth / 2);
    newSvg.appendChild(newPath);
    data.container.div.appendChild(newSvg);
    data.element = newSvg;
  },
  onDrawing: (data, viewContainer) => {
    expandContainer(data);
    const boxSize = getBoxSize(data);
    const newSvg = createSvg(boxSize.width, boxSize.height);
    const path = svgPathFromData(data, viewContainer);
    newSvg.appendChild(path);
    data.container.div.innerHTML = "";
    data.container.div.appendChild(newSvg);
    data.element = newSvg;
  },
  onDrawEnd: (data) => {
    // console.log("free draw end");
  },
  onResize: (data, ctx) => {
    if (!data.element) {
      return;
    }
    scaleSvg(data.element as SVGSVGElement, data.container.bounds);
  },
  cursor: `url('data:image/svg+xml;base64,${cursorPencilBase64}') 0 16, pointer`,
};
```
